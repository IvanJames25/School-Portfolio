<h2>Introduction</h2>

- <b>Hi, my name is Ivan James, and Iâ€™m a student with a strong passion for design, technology, and data. Iâ€™ve been learning UX/UI design and have already created some prototypes using Figma, which helped me understand how to design user-friendly digital experiences. Iâ€™m also eager to learn coding so I can turn my designs into real, working products. In addition, Iâ€™m interested in data analysis and want to explore how data can improve user experiences and guide better design decisions. Iâ€™m excited to keep learning and growing in all these areas.</b>
